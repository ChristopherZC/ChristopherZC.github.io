title: "Story Shaping: Teaching Agents Human-like Behavior with Stories"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/story-shaping
excerpt: 'Reward design for reinforcement learning agents is challenging when the method of achieving goals matters, such as adhering to commonsense or specific behavioral preferences. We present Story Shaping, a new technique, to help agents infer and align their actions with tacit knowledge from exemplar stories, using knowledge graphs to generate intrinsic rewards based on the similarity between the agent's actions and the story's world.'
