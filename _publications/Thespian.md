collection: publications
permalink: /publication/thespian
excerpt: 'Text-adventure and text role-playing games pose significant challenges for reinforcement learning agents. We introduce a "thespian agent" framework that can emulate multiple characters, using a soft prompt for direction and an attention mechanism for few-shot learning. Our agent surpasses the current state-of-the-art in multi-character and few-shot learning.
