I'm an incoming PhD student at UC San Diego, to be advised by Dr. Prithviraj Ammanabrolu, united in our love for boba tea and our interest in embodied RL agents and interactive, human-aligned AI systems. 

Prior to this, I did my Master's at the Georgia Institute of Technology, working with Dr. Thad Starner and Dr. Mark Riedl. With Dr. Starner, I headed the EdTools research team, building solutions for the common problems that instructors face as their classrooms balloon from tens to hundreds of students. With Dr. Riedl, I studied Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents in Open-World Text-Adventure Games and Story Generation.

In general, I am interested in all things Natural Language Processing (NLP) and any systems that collaborate with people to improve the human experience as a whole. I see the future of AI as one where people work alongside intelligent systems rather than one where we are replaced by them.
